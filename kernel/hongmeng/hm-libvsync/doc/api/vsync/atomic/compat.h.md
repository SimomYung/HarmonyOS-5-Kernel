#  [vsync](../README.md) / [atomic](README.md) / compat.h
_Set of functions backward compatible with libvsync 1.0._ 

check [atomic.h](../atomic.h.md) for detailed documentation. Compat is only available for `atomic32_t`, `atomic64_t` and `atomicptr_t`, which map to `vatomic32_t`, `vatomic64_t` and `vatomicptr_t` respectively.

These functions are deprecated. Please, use the new vatomic interface.
