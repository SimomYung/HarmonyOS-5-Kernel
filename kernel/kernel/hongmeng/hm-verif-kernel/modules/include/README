Module include header files hierarchy specification
===================================================
There gonna be several modules under developing, here
comes the specification for header files hierarchy.

Ongoing refactor shall follow these rules:
Header file hierarchy:
1.  include/mapi: directory used for header files commonly shared by multiple modules.
    Non commonly shared header files shall be placed under its own dir according to 2.

1.1 include/mapi/lib: common shared utility library dir for modules, such as
    rbtree, spinlock and so on.

1.2 include/mapi/uapi/xxx(xxx is module name): dir specially used to export ABI to
    user space, refer to USERINCLUDE and USERAPPINCLUDE definition is Makefile.master.

2.  header files specially for module named xxx: that the recommended way is: Putting
    respective header files together with src files, the same way as Linux.
    To include these file, xxx's Makefile has to explicitly include it.
