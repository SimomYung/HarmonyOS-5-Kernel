config KERNEL_CODEMERGE
	bool "enable CodeMerge in kernel"
	default n
	help
	  Improve the kernel performance by using compiler optimization.
	  CodeMerge includes these compiler passes:PGO, Function Reorder,
	  Hot-Cold Split and Unplt.
	  It is a feature based on profiling data and needs to update when
	  version of kernel changes.

config KERNEL_CODEMERGE_ENTRY_INSTR
	bool "enable Entry instrumentation feature in kernel"
	depends on KERNEL_CODEMERGE
	default n
	help
	  Different from the common instrumentation, the entry instrumentation
	  ensures that instrumentation is performed at the entry of a function.
	  Therefore, the entry instrumentation can records more accurate
	  runtime information.
	  Note that the compilation time may be prolonged after this feature
	  is enabled.
	  If this feature is enabled, CodeMerge will use another profdata.
	  This feature can be enabled only if KERNEL_CODEMERGE is enabled.

config KERNEL_CODEMERGE_MFS
	bool "enable MFS feature in kernel"
	depends on KERNEL_CODEMERGE
	default n
	help
	  Improve Hot-Cold Split to Machine Function Split. This is a more
	  efficient way to separate hot and cold sections without adding
	  redundant instructions.
	  Because this feature is based on profiling data, it can be enabled
	  only if KERNEL_CODEMERGE is enabled.
